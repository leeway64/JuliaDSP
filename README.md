# LWJuliaDSP

A collection of several DSP functions, written in Julia. The functions provided perform the Fourier
transform, the inverse Fourier transform, and convolution.

Refer to the [usage examples](docs/usage_examples.md) for more information on how to use the
functions.


## Unit Tests

To run unit tests, run:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/leeway64/LWJuliaDSP.git
julia tests/unit_tests.jl
```


## Third Party Software

- None. LWJuliaDSP uses only the base Julia features.
